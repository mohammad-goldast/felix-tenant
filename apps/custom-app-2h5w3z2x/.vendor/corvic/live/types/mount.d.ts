/**
 * One mount, one engine, one router.
 *
 * `mountApp` is how every app boots. It owns the DuckDB engine (one per document;
 * a navigation must not cost a 40 MB recompile), the router (an in-app link must
 * not tear down the realm), and the resolved theme. Markup, CSS, framework, and
 * refresh cadence belong to the pages.
 *
 * A page is a function of its context: it renders into `ctx.content`, reads data
 * through `ctx.db`, and returns an optional cleanup. Routes are lazy (code-split);
 * the panel path is an ordinary route (see {@link panelPage}).
 *
 * `URLPattern` matches routes and the Navigation API intercepts them. Both are
 * required: without them every click reloads the document and the engine.
