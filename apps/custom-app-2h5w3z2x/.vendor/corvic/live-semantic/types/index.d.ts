/**
 * @corvic/live-semantic — what a number means, and what will fit.
 *
 * A catalog declares a source's columns, the cuts through it and the measures
 * over it; `compile` turns a request against one into SQL and into the facts a
 * caption needs; `fit` answers what a request costs and what to ask instead when
 * the room is smaller than the answer. Nothing here draws anything, reaches for a
 * document, or knows what a chart is — `@corvic/live-ui` binds this to pixels,
 * and the same request compiles the same way with no page at all.
 *
 * The catalogs are the app's: a declaration about data is authored beside the
 * data. The fixture these laws are stated over is not exported: a library that
 * ships its test population invites a page to draw it.
