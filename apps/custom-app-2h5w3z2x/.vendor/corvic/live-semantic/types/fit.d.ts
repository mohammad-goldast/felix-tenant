/**
 * Projecting a request onto what its destination will accept.
 *
 * One operation with several names. Narrowing a broad edit is this, where the
 * destination is a component and the thing it will not accept is a shape it
 * cannot draw. Reducing a page for a smaller surface is this, where the
 * destination is a medium and the thing it will not accept is a number of
 * facts. A pivot is a person doing it by hand, in either direction.
 *
 * The ladder is monotone toward safety for a flow: every rung sheds facts and
 * every request is compiled fresh from the source, so coarsening toward the
 * total only removes the non-additive series the catalog already refuses.
 *
 * It is not monotone for a level. Coarsening a grain merges periods, and a stock
 * summed over the periods it was counted in is a wrong number the finer request
 * did not have — so a rung here can reach an answer that needs a different
 * aggregation. Nothing below consults additivity, which is only correct once
 * `compile` aggregates a semi-additive measure along time as a level; until then
 * see the failing law in `measure.test.ts`.

 * and for eight lines; multiplied that is a budget of thirteen hundred, which a
 * hundred and seventy-seven accounts over six months fits inside — and it drew a
 * hundred and seventy-seven lines. Colour does not get roomier when the box does.
 *
 * `along` is the axis and `apart` is what the second channel keeps separate,

 * two reasons it was tried and dropped are worth keeping:
 *
 * **Whether to reduce is a question about pixels.** A request the destination
 * accepts comes back as asked, even where a coarser grain carries the same
 * signal for fewer marks. Retention decides *what* to give up once room has run
 * out; a hundred and fifty-seven columns that fit are a claim about how wide a
 * column can be, and belong to `capacity`. Spending the measurement on a
 * request nobody refused is second-guessing the author with a statistic.
 *
 * **An insignificant difference is still an answer.** The four regions hold
 * pipeline within noise of each other, which the profile now measures
 * correctly, and four equal bars say *these are the same* where a total cannot.
 * A rule reading equal retention as permission to drop the cut would answer a
 * question nobody asked. Ties therefore go to the finer rung: retention of one
 * usually means *below the noise floor*, and the humble
 * reading of a tie is to keep what was asked for.
 *
 * `subject` is the request the component asked for before anything was done to
 * it, and marks the cuts that are the point. A chart of
 * pipeline by region asked for the region split; if something later adds a time
 * grain and the result no longer fits, the grain goes and the split stays. Two
 * cuts are always droppable in some order and only the caller knows which one
 * was the subject, so it says.
 *
 * Null means nothing fits, which is a refusal.
