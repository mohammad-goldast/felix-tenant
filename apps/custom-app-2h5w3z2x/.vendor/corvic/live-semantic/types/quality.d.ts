/**
 * A count over an extracted index is classify-and-count.
 *
 * Counting the rows an extractor produced inherits the extractor's bias: a type it is
 * generous about inflates every total over it, a type it is cautious about deflates one, and
 * no amount of care in the SQL notices either. The literature names the estimator Classify
 * and Count, and names its corrections. The correction is declared here; the cut it may be
 * asked at is the gold set's strata.
 *
 * The correction is **Adjusted Count**: `(observed − fpr · n) / (tpr − fpr)`, clipped to
 * the feasible range. It is affine in the observed and total counts. Summing corrected
 * counts over cells equals correcting the summed counts exactly when `tpr` and `fpr` are
 * the same on every cell (§8.3). They usually are not — extraction is worse on the long
 * tail, on one language, on scanned pages — so rates are per stratum, and a gold set with
 * no stratum to speak of is refused.
 *
 * Distinct from `spread`. `spread` is the sampling error of a mean: it corrects nothing,
 * and it assumes readings drawn from a population. An adjusted count corrects a bias in
 * **index membership** — in which things are there at all — and it is a different estimator
 * of a different quantity. The raw count keeps its own name and stays available unchanged.
 *
 * A statement, following `edges.ts`: a corrected count is asked for by naming the count and
 * the strata, and the answer is compiled from the same request the page would otherwise
 * have shown, so the corrected figure is a correction of that number.

/**
 * One row of a judgements table: something the extractor was shown, and what it is.
 *
 * The shape an extraction run owes an evaluation beyond its output. A finished index holds
 * the rows the extractor *accepted*; a false-positive rate is a rate over the ones it
 * declined, and neither those nor their labels are recoverable from what landed. So the run
 * reports its decisions and a person labels some of them, and the two arrive as one row per
 * candidate.
 *
 * One table: a label for something the run never classified has no row to be written in.
 * That is capture–recapture — how much an extractor never found — and it is not answerable
 * from a gold set drawn out of what it did.
 *
 * `stratum` is read off what the extractor could see, never off the label. A stratum
 * computed from the truth is one no run could compute at the time it mattered, and the
 * correction would then be a number nobody can reproduce outside the evaluation.
