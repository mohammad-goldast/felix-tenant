 * Measure a source, producing the `SourceProfile` a catalog is read with.

 * The other half of `profile.ts`: that module says what a profile is, and this one
 * says how to get one. Both are here, in the package that owns the type, so a
 * profiler reads a catalog directly.
 *
 * No engine here, for the same reason `compile` has none: this emits the SQL and
 * the caller runs it. `ask` is that caller, which keeps the dependency pointing the
 * way every other module in this package points and lets a law drive the whole
 * thing from a fixture.
 *
 * Three rounds, because each depends on the last: which columns exist decides what
 * to measure, and the range a quantity's readings cover decides which widths there
 * are to lay over it.
